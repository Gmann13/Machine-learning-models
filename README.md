# Machine Learning Projects

**Description:**  
This repository contains two machine learning projects: a **K-Means Algorithm** implementation and an **Iris Classification** project. Both projects showcase different machine learning techniques for clustering and classification using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## Project 1: Iris Classification

### Description:
The Iris Classification project uses the Iris dataset to classify the species of iris flowers based on their features. Three models are compared: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each model's accuracy is evaluated, and predictions are made on the validation set.

### Key Features:
- Dataset preprocessing and exploration.
- Model training using Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM.
- Evaluation using cross-validation and accuracy scores.

### Dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Iris Classification notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_project.ipynb
   ```

### Results:
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 1.0
- KNN Accuracy: 0.98
- SVM Accuracy: 1.0

## Project 2: K-Means Algorithm

### Description:
This project demonstrates the use of the K-Means clustering algorithm. It generates two sets of data points with random means and applies K-Means to cluster the data into 4 clusters. The centroids of the clusters and labels are printed, and the results are visualized using Matplotlib.

### Key Features:
- Data generation using multivariate normal distribution.
- K-Means clustering on generated data.
- Visualization of clustered data and centroids.

### Dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script to generate data and perform clustering:
   ```bash
   python kmeans_algorithm.py
   ```
